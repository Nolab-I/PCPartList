# PCPartList

just for funsies

you make lists of PC parts in a build.

A build has price, power usage, and parts. There are a few default parts. These are CPU, Motherboard, GPU, RAM, PSU, Cooler, and Case.
You add parts with their name, price, powerdraw(only some parts), and optionally, a link to purchase website.

This is written in Java because I like to suffer apparently.
