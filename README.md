# PCPartList (WIP)

just for funsies

you make lists of PC parts in a build.

A build has price, power usage, and parts.
You add parts with their name, price, powerdraw(0 for some), and optionally, a link to purchase website.

This is written in Java because I like to suffer apparently.

#### JAVA 11 AT LEAST REQUIRED
#### Complie.sh is only verified to work on Linux - Windows = maybe, OSX = maybe
